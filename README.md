# Application evaluation
***Data cleaning and processing in Python (Jupyter Notebook)***

<br>
This project aimed to clean and process data from 2 CSV files, including appropriately merging tables and subsequently determining the final score for each applicant based on predefined criteria. Each of the 6 criteria could earn a specific number of points, with a maximum total of 100 points. Applications with a final score greater than 0 points were accepted, and the average score of accepted applications for each week of the year was calculated and presented on the graph.
